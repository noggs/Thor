1. Create Z-GBuffer to contain 16bit depth + 16bit normal (xy)
2. Render scene into Z-GBuffer using custom pixel shader

3. Create Light buffer containing 32 bits of something
4. For each light render the info into the buffer

5. Switch to forward render and look-up into light buffer for lighting information
