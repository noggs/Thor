Light pre-pass renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[DONE] 1. Create Z-GBuffer to contain 16bit depth + 16bit normal (xy)
[DONE] 2. Render scene into Z-GBuffer using custom pixel shader (screen-space normals)
[DONE] 2a. Render ZGBuffer onto corner of the screen
[DONE] 2b. For debug decode normal and depth and draw to seperate screen areas

[DONE] 3. Create Light buffer containing 32 bits of something
[DONE] 4. For each light render the info into the buffer
[DONE] 4a. Implement directional and ambient 
[DONE] 4b. Implement point light
4bI. Divide screen into tiles
[DONE] 5. Switch to forward render and look-up into light buffer for lighting information
6. Use linear depth instead of /w depth


Divide screen into tiles
Transform light volumes into screenspace
Sort tiles by number of lights
For each tile group set technique, light info and render tiles

OR

For each light
Transform volume into viewspace
per-pixel:
	Use inverse Proj matrix to get viewspace position
	



Misc
~~~~
Handle textured models (names/purpose [nrm/dif/spc] in model format)
FPS counter
Build system for assets...!


Code Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Renderer class 
	Handle drawing rendertargets without using GUI class (change shaders etc)
[DONE] Use FX instead of psh/vsh
Shader library?
Texture loader / library
Camera class
Scene class

Physics engine integration
Scene editor integration
